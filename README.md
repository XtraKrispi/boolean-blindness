# Boolean Blindness: Using domain modelling to make your code bug free

## Abstract:

Have you ever mixed up parameters because they were the same type? Have you had to refer to documentation just to understand what parameters are what? Have you ever gotten into a situation that _"should never happen"_?

In this talk, Michael Gold will take you on a whirlwind tour of domain modelling, using booleans as a jumping off point, to make your code more **readable**, **understandable** and **safe**. We're going to take the concept of **"making impossible states unrepresentable"** to illustrate how solid domain modelling can help reduce bugs in your code. We will be looking at `Typescript` and `F#` for this talk, but concepts can extend to other languages.
